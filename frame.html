<h1>  Hypertext Markup Language </h1> 
<p>
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
     for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can 
     be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
     and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
     constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms
      may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means 
      to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
    for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and
    other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
    angle brackets. Tags such as "img" and "input " directly 
    introduce content into the page. Other tags such as 'p' surround
    and provide information about document text and may include
    other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML
    tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
    which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS
    defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium 
    (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
    standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational
     HTML since 1997.
